## ✨ What is rallies-cli?

Rallies CLI is an intelligent investment research agent built by [Rallies](https://rallies.ai) that combines the conversational power of AI with real-time financial data. Think of it as ChatGPT specifically designed for traders and investors, equipped with live market data, news feeds, and comprehensive financial analysis capabilities.

#### What's different from ChatGPT, Perplexity Finance, etc?

Most AI tools like ChatGPT rely on outdated market data and web searches that aren't real-time. Try asking them "summarize today's options flow for AAPL" or "find stocks with inside day patterns today" - they simply can't deliver accurate, current results because they lack live financial data.

Rallies-cli is different. It's powered by real-time market data that updates continuously, enabling complex queries that other AI tools can't handle. This means you get accurate, current analysis instead of outdated information from web searches.
 
## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rallies-cli.git
cd rallies-cli
pip install -e .


# Install from PyPI
pip install rallies
```

### Setup

1. **Get your API key** from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) or [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2. **Set environment variables**:

   For OpenAI:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
   ```

   For Gemini:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   export RALLIES="gemini"
   ```
3. **Launch rallies from your terminal**:

   ```

That's it! You're ready to start researching.
